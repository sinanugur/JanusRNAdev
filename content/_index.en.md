## JanusRNA Project

### Background
Cancer is the third-most common cause of death worldwide, the most common cause of death in men
and women under the age of 70, and the second leading cause of death overall in Norway. Cancer
development involves progressive accumulation of molecular changes in the genome and the epigenome. The challenges in cancer management are to succeed in early detection, to improve diagnostic precision, to offer an appropriate therapy and follow-up, all aimed at reducing suffering and prolonging survival.

**JanusRNA** is an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) project that investigates circulating RNA profiles of human serum to detect non-invasive early detection biomarkers of cancer, including lung, coleractal, testis etc.
